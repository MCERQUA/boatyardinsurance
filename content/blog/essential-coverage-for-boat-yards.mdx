# Essential Insurance Coverage Every Boat Yard Needs

Operating a boat yard comes with unique risks that standard business insurance simply doesn't cover. From expensive vessels in your care to specialized equipment and waterfront operations, boat yards face exposures that require specialized insurance solutions.

## The Unique Risks of Boat Yard Operations

Boat yards handle high-value assets daily. A single yacht in for repairs could be worth more than your entire facility. Add in the risks of:

- **Heavy equipment operations** (travel lifts, forklifts)
- **Hazardous materials** (paints, solvents, fuel)
- **Working near or on water**
- **Storing customer property**

You begin to understand why generic business insurance falls short.

## Core Coverages for Boat Yards

### 1. General Liability Insurance

This is your foundation. General liability protects against:
- Customer injuries on your property
- Property damage caused by your operations
- Advertising and personal injury claims

For boat yards, you'll want limits of at least $1 million per occurrence and $2 million aggregate.

### 2. Care, Custody, and Control (CCC) Coverage

This is arguably the most important coverage for boat yards. Standard liability policies exclude damage to property in your care—which is literally your entire business model.

CCC coverage (also called marine bailee coverage) protects customer boats while:
- In storage at your facility
- During haul-out and launch
- While being serviced or repaired

### 3. Property Insurance

Covers your buildings, equipment, tools, and inventory. Key considerations:
- Replacement cost vs. actual cash value
- Coverage for specialized equipment (travel lifts can cost $500K+)
- Business interruption coverage if disaster strikes

### 4. Workers Compensation

Required in most states, workers comp is essential for boat yards given the physical nature of the work. Marine operations have higher injury rates than many industries.

## Additional Coverages to Consider

- **Pollution Liability**: For fuel spills, paint, and solvent releases
- **Commercial Auto**: For service vehicles and boat transport
- **Umbrella/Excess Liability**: Extra protection above primary limits
- **Cyber Liability**: If you store customer payment information

## Getting the Right Coverage

Work with an insurance agent who specializes in marine businesses. They understand the unique needs of boat yards and have access to carriers who write this specialized coverage.
