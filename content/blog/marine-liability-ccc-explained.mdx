# Care, Custody & Control Coverage: What Boat Yards Need to Know

If you operate a boat yard, marina, or marine repair facility, there's one coverage gap that could put you out of business overnight: damage to boats in your care.

## The Coverage Gap Problem

Here's a scenario that plays out too often:

A $200,000 sport fisher is in your yard for bottom paint. During a storm, your travel lift fails and the boat crashes to the ground. Total loss.

You file a claim with your general liability insurer. They deny it. Why?

**Standard general liability policies exclude property in your "care, custody, or control."**

This exclusion exists because GL policies are designed to cover accidental damage to third-party property—not property you've voluntarily taken possession of. That's a fundamentally different risk.

## What Is Care, Custody & Control Coverage?

CCC coverage (sometimes called marine bailee insurance or customer boat coverage) is specifically designed to fill this gap. It covers damage to customer vessels while:

- **Stored** at your facility (on land or in water)
- **Being hauled** in and out of the water
- **Under repair** or service
- **In transit** if you transport boats

## What CCC Coverage Includes

A comprehensive CCC policy covers:

### Physical Damage
- Storm damage (wind, hail, lightning)
- Fire
- Collision during transport or movement
- Vandalism and malicious mischief
- Theft (yes, boats get stolen from yards)

### Equipment Failure
- Travel lift or crane accidents
- Forklift mishaps
- Jack stand or cradle failures

### Operational Errors
- Employee negligence
- Improper blocking or storage
- Damage during sea trials

## Coverage Limits: How Much Do You Need?

Consider the maximum value of boats you might have at your facility at any one time. This includes:

- All boats in storage
- Boats actively being worked on
- Boats awaiting pickup

Many boat yards need $1-5 million in CCC coverage. High-end facilities handling mega-yachts may need $10 million or more.

## Deductibles and Cost Factors

CCC coverage typically has higher deductibles than general liability—often $5,000-$25,000 per occurrence. Factors affecting your premium include:

- Total capacity (number of boats)
- Maximum boat value
- Types of services offered
- Claims history
- Security measures
- Location (hurricane zones cost more)

## Don't Operate Without It

Without CCC coverage, a single incident could result in a lawsuit that exceeds your entire business value. Given the high-value assets boat yards handle, this coverage isn't optional—it's essential.
